Migration from Legacy
=====================

Due to the multi-backend approach and storage structure of ``python-omemo``, migrations are provided by backends rather than the core library. For users of legacy ``python-omemo`` (i.e. versions before 1.0.0) with ``python-omemo-backend-signal``, the `python-oldmemo <https://github.com/Syndace/python-oldmemo>`_ package provides migrations. Please refer to the backend documentation for details.

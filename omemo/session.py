    Class representing an OMEMO session. Used to encrypt/decrypt key material for/from a single
    recipient/sender device in a perfectly forwared secure manner.

    Warning:
        Changes to a session may only be persisted when :meth:`~omemo.backend.Backend.store_session` is
        called.

    Warning:
        Multiple sessions for the same device can exist in memory, however only one session per device can
        exist in storage. Which one of the in-memory sessions is persisted in storage is controlled by calling
        the :meth:`~omemo.backend.Backend.store_session` method.

    Note:
        The API of the :class:`Session` class was intentionally kept thin. All "complex" interactions with
        session objects happen via methods of :class:`~omemo.backend.Backend`. This allows backend
        implementors to have the :class:`Session` class be a simple "stupid" data holding structure type,
        while all of the more complex logic is located in the implementation of the
        :class:`~omemo.backend.Backend` class itself. Backend implementations  are obviously free to implement
        logic on their respective :class:`Session` implementations and forward calls to them from the
        :class:`~omemo.backend.Backend` methods.

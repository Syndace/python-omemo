class Backend(ABC):
    """
    The base class for all backends. A backend is a unit providing the functionality of a certain OMEMO
    version to the core library.

    Warning:
        Make sure to call :meth:`__init__` from your subclass to configure per-message and per-session skipped
        message key DoS protection thresholds, and respect those thresholds when decrypting key material using
        :meth:`decrypt_key_material`.

    Note:
        Most methods can raise :class:`~omemo.storage.StorageException` in addition to those exceptions
        listed explicitly.

    Note:
        All usages of "identity key" in the public API refer to the public part of the identity key pair in
        Ed25519 format. Otherwise, "identity key pair" is explicitly used to refer to the full key pair.

    Note:
        For backend implementors: as part of your backend implementation, you are expected to subclass various
        abstract base classes like :class:`~omemo.session.Session`, :class:`~omemo.message.Content`,
        :class:`~omemo.message.PlainKeyMaterial`, :class:`~omemo.message.EncryptedKeyMaterial` and
        :class:`~omemo.message.KeyExchange`. Whenever any of these abstract base types appears in a method
        signature of the :class:`Backend` class, what's actually meant is an instance of your respective
        subclass. This is not correctly expressed through the type system, since I couldn't think of a clean
        way to do so. Adding generics for every single of these types seemed not worth the effort. For now,
        the recommended way to deal with this type inaccuray is to assert the types of the affected method
        parameters, for example::

            async def store_session(self, session: Session) -> Any:
                assert isinstance(session, MySessionImpl)

                ...

        Doing so tells mypy how to deal with the situation. These assertions should never fail.

    Note:
        For backend implementors: you can access the identity key pair at any time via
        :meth:`omemo.identity_key_pair.IdentityKeyPair.get`.

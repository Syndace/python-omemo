    of them. Easy APIs are provided to handle common use-cases of OMEMO-enabled XMPP clients, with one of the
    primary goals being strict type safety.

        Load or create OMEMO backends. This method takes care of everything regarding the initialization of
        OMEMO: generating a unique device id, uploading the bundle and adding the new device to the device
        list. While doing so, it makes sure that all backends share the same identity key, so that a certain
        level of compatibility between the backends can be achieved. If a backend was created before, this
        method loads the backend from the storage instead of creating it.

        Args:
            backends: The list of backends to use.
            storage: The storage for all OMEMO-related data.
            own_bare_jid: The own bare JID of the account this device belongs to.
            initial_own_label: The initial (optional) label to assign to this device if supported by any of
                the backends.
            undecided_trust_level_name: The name of the custom trust level to initialize the trust level with
                when a new device is first encoutered. :meth:`_evaluate_custom_trust_level` should evaluate
                this custom trust level to :attr:`~omemo.types.TrustLevel.UNDECIDED`.
            signed_pre_key_rotation_period: The rotation period for the signed pre key, in seconds. The
                rotation period is recommended to be between one week (the default) and one month.
            pre_key_refill_threshold: The number of pre keys that triggers a refill to 100. Defaults to 99,
                which means that each pre key gets replaced with a new one right away. The threshold can not
                be configured to lower than 25.
            async_framework: The framework to use to create asynchronous tasks and perform asynchronous
                waiting. Defaults to asyncio, since it's part of the standard library. Make sure the
                respective framework is installed when using something other than asyncio.

        Returns:
            A configured instance of :class:`~omemo.session_manager.SessionManager`, with all backends loaded,
            bundles published and device lists adjusted.

        Raises:
            BundleUploadFailed: if a bundle upload failed. Forwarded from :meth:`_upload_bundle`.
            BundleDownloadFailed: if a bundle download failed. Forwarded from :meth:`_download_bundle`.
            BundleDeletionFailed: if a bundle deletion failed. Forwarded from :meth:`_delete_bundle`.
            DeviceListUploadFailed: if a device list upload failed. Forwarded from
                :meth:`_upload_device_list`.
            DeviceListDownloadFailed: if a device list download failed. Forwarded from
                :meth:`_download_device_list`.

        Warning:
            The library starts in history synchronization mode. Call :meth:`after_history_sync` to return to
            normal operation. Refer to the documentation of :meth:`before_history_sync` and
            :meth:`after_history_sync` for details.

        Warning:
            The library takes care of keeping online data in sync. That means, if the library is loaded
            without a backend that was loaded before, it will remove all online data related to the missing
            backend and as much of the offline data as possible (refer to :meth:`purge_backend` for details).

        Note:
            This method takes care of leaving the device lists in a consistent state. To do so, backends are
            "initialized" one after the other. For each backend, the device list is updated as the very last
            step, after everything else that could fail is done. This ensures that either all data is
            consistent or the device list does not yet list the inconsistent device. If the creation of one
            backend succeeds, the data is persisted in the storage before the next backend is created. This
            guarantees that even if the next backend creation fails, the data is not lost and will be loaded
            from the storage when calling this method again.

        Note:
            The order of the backends can optionally be used by :meth:`encrypt` as the order of priority, in
            case a recipient device supports multiple backends. Refer to the documentation of :meth:`encrypt`
            for details.

        # - It doesn't matter if a message is encrypted, the corresponding session is stored, and a failure
        #   occurs afterwards. The cryptography/ratchet will not break if that happens.
        # - Because of the previous point, library-scoped failures like storage failures can crash the whole
        #   encryption process without risking inconsistencies.

        #   fetches/key agreements with new devices. Those failures must not prevent the encryption for the
        #   other devices to fail. Instead, those failures are collected and returned together with the
        #   successful encryption results, such that the library user can decide how to react in detail.

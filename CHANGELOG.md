### Added
- A new method `shutdown` to gracefully quit internal tasks

### Changed
- Removed type annotations from enum members in accordance with a new mypy rule
- Simplified the `JSONType` type now that recursive aliases are properly supported

### Removed
- Removed project.py and simplified version.py as part of the migration towards pyproject.toml

## [1.2.0] - 15th of October, 2024

### Changed
- Slightly improved logging for less spam and more clarity
- Drop support for Python3.8, add support for Python3.13, bump PyPy test version to 3.10
- Internal housekeeping, mostly related to pylint

## [1.1.0] - 28th of September, 2024

### Changed
- No changes; the last release should have been a new minor version.

## [1.0.5] - 25th of September, 2024

### Added
- A new method `refresh_device_lists` that calls `refresh_device_list` for all loaded backends.

## [1.0.4] - 14th of July, 2024

### Fixed
- Attempt to fix a storage data inconsistency where namespace support is stored for a device but activity information is not

## [1.0.3] - 9th of July, 2024

### Changed
- Removed unnecessary complexity/flexibility by returning `None` instead of `Any` from abstract methods whose return values are not used
- The bundle publishing logic in the signed pre key rotation did not correctly double the retry delay
- Log message improvements
- 2024 maintenance (bumped Python versions, adjusted for updates to pydantic, mypy, pylint, pytest and GitHub actions)

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where a modified bundle might not be uploaded correctly

## [1.0.2] - 4th of November, 2022

### Added
- A new exception `BundleNotFound`, raised by `_download_bundle`, to allow differentiation between technical bundle download failures and the simple absence of a bundle

### Changed
- A small change in the package detection in setup.py led to a broken PyPI package
- Improved download failure exception semantics and removed incorrect raises annotations

## [1.0.1] - 3rd of November, 2022

### Added
- Python 3.11 to the list of supported versions

## [1.0.0] - 1st of November, 2022

### Changed
- Complete rewrite of the library (and dependencies) to use asynchronous and (strictly) typed Python 3.
- Support for different versions of [XEP-0384](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) via separate backend packages.
- Mostly following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) now (except for the date format).

## [0.14.0] - 12th of March, 2022

### Changed
- Adjusted signature of the `SessionManager.encryptRatchetForwardingMessage` method to accept exactly one bare JID + device id pair
- Updated the license in the setup.py, which was desync with the LICENSE file
- Adjusted the copyright year

### Removed
- Removed Python 3.4 from the list of supported Python versions
- Removed some mentions of Python 2 from the README

## [0.13.0] - 15th of December 2021

### Added
- Added a method to retrieve the receiving chain length of a single session form the `SessionManager`

### Changed
- The storage interface has been modified to use asyncio coroutines instead of callbacks.
- All methods of the session manager that returned promises previously have been replaced with equivalent asyncio coroutines.

### Removed
- Dropped Python 2 support and removed a bit of Python 2 compatibility clutter
- Removed synchronous APIs
- Removed thread-based promise implementation in favor of asyncio futures and coroutines

## [0.12.0] - 28th of March, 2020

### Changed
- The `JSONFileStorage` now encodes JIDs using hashes, to avoid various issues regarding the file system. **WARNING, THERE ARE KNOWN ISSUES WITH THIS VERSION OF THE STORAGE IMPLEMENTATION.**
- Sending 12 byte IVs instead of 16 now.
- `SessionManager.encryptKeyTransportMessage` now receives the optional plaintext as a parameter directly, instead of using a callback to encrypt external data. If the plaintext is omitted, a shared secret is returned that can be used for purposes external to this library.
- Switched to MIT license with the agreement of all contributors!

### Fixed
- Fixed the way key transport messages are sent and received to be compatible with other implementations.

## [0.11.0] - 13th of December, 2019

### Added
- Added a new method `resetTrust`, which allows going back to the trust level `undecided`.

### Changed
- Merged the `trust` and `distrust` methods into `setTrust`.
- `Storage.storeTrust` must now be able to handle the value `None` for the `trust` parameter.

### Removed
- Removed the `SessionManagerAsyncIO`, in preparation for the big Python 3 update coming soonâ„¢.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in the `SessionManager`, where the contents of a parameter (passed by reference) were modified.

## [0.10.5] - 21st of July, 2019

### Fixed
- Fixed two bugs in the `JSONFileStorage` implementation.
- Fixed a type issue in the `__str__` of the `TrustException`.
- Fixed a rare bug where sessions uncapable of encrypting messages would be stored.

## [0.10.4] - 1st of February, 2019

### Added
- Added an implementation of the storage using a simple directory structure and JSON files.

### Changed
- `RatchetForwardingMessages` do not require the recipient to be trusted any more, as they contain no user-generated content. See #22 for information.
- Renamed `UntrustedException` to `TrustException` and added a fourth field `problem` to get the type of problem (untrusted vs. undecided).

## [0.10.3] - 29th of December, 2018

### Added
- Added a method for requesting trust information from the storage at bulk. This can be overridden for better performance.
- Added a method for requesting sessions from the storage at bulk. This can be overridden for better performance.
- Added a public method to delete an existing session. This is useful to recover from broken sessions.
- Added a public method to retrieve a list of all managed JIDs.
- Added a stresstest, mostly to test recursion depth.

### Changed
- Turned the changelog upside-down, so that the first entry is the newest.
- Modified `no_coroutine` in the promise lib to use a loop instead of recursion.
- Modified the promise constructor to run promises in threads.

## [0.10.2] - 29th of December, 2018

### Added
- Added methods to retrieve trust information from the `SessionManager`: `getTrustForDevice` and `getTrustForJID`.

### Changed
- Introduced an exception hierarchy to allow for more fine-grained exception catching and type checking.
- Most exceptions now implement `__str__` to generate human-readable messages.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that tried to instantiate an object of the wrong class from serialized data.

## [0.10.1] - 27th of December, 2018

### Added
- Added CHANGELOG.

### Changed
- Upon serialization the current library version is added to the serialized structures, to allow for seamless updates in the future.
